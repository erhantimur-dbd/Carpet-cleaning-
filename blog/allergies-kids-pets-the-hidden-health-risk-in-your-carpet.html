                    <section id="floor-level">
                        <h2>The floor-level problem</h2>
                        <p>Most adults spend their time at standing or sitting height — roughly 90cm to 170cm above the floor. At that elevation, you're breathing relatively clean room air. But the first 30cm above the carpet is a different environment entirely.</p>
                        <p>Research from the <em>Journal of Exposure Science &amp; Environmental Epidemiology</em> has shown that <strong>pollutant concentrations at floor level can be two to five times higher</strong> than at adult breathing height. Dust, allergens, bacteria, and volatile compounds settle downward and accumulate in the carpet pile, creating a concentrated zone of contamination right where children play, babies crawl, and pets rest.</p>
                        <p>This isn't about visible dirt. A carpet can look perfectly clean and still harbour enough dust mite allergen, pet dander, and bacteria in its fibres to trigger symptoms in sensitive individuals. The problem is invisible — and that's exactly what makes it dangerous.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Section: Allergies -->
                    <section id="allergies">
                        <h2>Carpets and allergies: the evidence</h2>
                        <p>According to Allergy UK, <strong>over 20 million people in the UK</strong> suffer from at least one allergy, and indoor allergens are among the most common triggers. Carpets are the single largest reservoir of indoor allergens in most homes.</p>
                        <p>The main culprits trapped in carpet fibres include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dust mite allergen (Der p 1)</strong> — produced by mite faecal pellets, this protein is the number one trigger for perennial allergic rhinitis in the UK. A single gram of carpet dust can contain up to 1,000 dust mites and 250,000 faecal pellets</li>
                            <li><strong>Pet dander</strong> — microscopic flakes of animal skin. Cat allergen (Fel d 1) is particularly problematic because the particles are tiny (under 2.5 microns), remain airborne for hours, and stick to carpet fibres with tenacious persistence</li>
                            <li><strong>Pollen</strong> — grass, tree, and weed pollen tracked indoors on shoes and clothing embeds in carpet fibres, extending allergy season indoors well beyond the outdoor pollen count</li>
                            <li><strong>Mould spores</strong> — any carpet that has been damp, been subject to unresolved spills, or sits in a humid room can harbour mould growth invisible from the surface</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When someone walks across a contaminated carpet, the mechanical action compresses the pile and expels a burst of these particles into the air. Studies using particle counters have measured <strong>allergen concentrations spiking five- to tenfold within seconds of foot traffic</strong> on a carpet that hasn't been professionally cleaned in over a year.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Section: Children -->
                    <section id="children">
                        <h2>Why children are most at risk</h2>
                        <p>Children aren't just small adults — their physiology and behaviour put them at disproportionately higher risk from carpet contamination.</p>
                        <p><strong>Closer to the source.</strong> Babies crawl. Toddlers sit, roll, and play on the floor. A crawling infant's nose is typically 5 to 15cm above the carpet — right in the zone of highest allergen and pollutant concentration. They're breathing air that an adult standing in the same room never encounters.</p>
                        <p><strong>Higher breathing rate.</strong> Children breathe faster than adults relative to their body weight. A toddler takes 20 to 30 breaths per minute compared to an adult's 12 to 20. This means they inhale more airborne particles per kilogram of body mass over the same period.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hand-to-mouth behaviour.</strong> Young children constantly touch surfaces and put their hands — and objects — in their mouths. Anything on the carpet surface (bacteria, residues, allergens) has a direct route into their system. The <em>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</em> identifies indoor allergen exposure in early childhood as a risk factor for developing asthma.</p>
                        <p><strong>Developing immune systems.</strong> A child's immune system is still maturing. Prolonged exposure to high levels of dust mite allergen during the first two years of life has been linked to a significantly increased risk of developing allergic sensitisation, according to research published in <em>The Lancet</em>.</p>
                        <p>This doesn't mean carpets are inherently bad for children — soft flooring is safer for falls and warmer for play. But it does mean that <strong>carpeted homes with young children need more frequent professional cleaning</strong>, not less.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Section: Pets -->
                    <section id="pets">
                        <h2>Pets: what they bring in and leave behind</h2>
                        <p>Pets are wonderful. They're also, from a carpet hygiene perspective, one of the most significant contributors to indoor allergen and bacterial load.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pet dander.</strong> Both cats and dogs shed dander continuously. Cat allergen (Fel d 1) is produced in the sebaceous glands and deposited on fur — from there it transfers to every surface the cat touches. Dog allergen (Can f 1) behaves similarly. These proteins are <strong>sticky</strong> — they bond to carpet fibres and resist hoovering. Even after a cat is removed from a home, Fel d 1 has been measured in carpets for <strong>up to six months</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Outdoor contaminants.</strong> Dogs that go for walks bring back more than mud. Paws track in bacteria, pesticide residues, pollen, and faecal matter from pavements and parks. A study from the University of Arizona found that <strong>96% of shoes carry faecal bacteria</strong> — and the same applies to paws. This is transferred directly to carpet with every step.</p>
                        <p><strong>Urine and saliva.</strong> Accidents happen, particularly with puppies, older dogs, and cats with litter tray issues. Even cleaned-up pet urine leaves behind uric acid crystals that embed in carpet backing and underlay. These crystals reactivate with humidity, producing odour and attracting bacteria. Pet saliva — deposited when animals groom themselves and then lie on carpet — contains allergen proteins that dry and become airborne.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fleas and parasites.</strong> Carpet is the preferred habitat for flea larvae. Flea eggs fall from pets into the carpet pile, where the warm, dark environment at the fibre base provides ideal conditions. Larvae feed on organic debris in the carpet for one to two weeks before pupating. A single female flea lays up to 50 eggs per day — a minor flea problem can escalate rapidly if the carpet isn't treated.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Section: Asthma -->
                    <section id="asthma">
                        <h2>The asthma connection</h2>
                        <p>Asthma affects <strong>5.4 million people in the UK</strong>, including 1.1 million children. It is the most common chronic condition in British children. And indoor allergen exposure — particularly from dust mites and pets — is one of the most significant and modifiable triggers.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>British Thoracic Society</strong> guidelines on asthma management specifically recommend reducing exposure to indoor allergens as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. The NHS advises that dust mite-proof bedding combined with regular professional carpet cleaning can significantly reduce allergen levels in the home.</p>
                        <p>Here's why carpets matter specifically for asthma:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dust mite allergen triggers airway inflammation</strong> — even in small quantities, Der p 1 provokes an IgE-mediated immune response in sensitised individuals, causing bronchial constriction and mucus production</li>
                            <li><strong>Pet allergens worsen symptoms</strong> — Fel d 1 particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs, and their sticky nature means they accumulate to high levels in carpeted homes with cats</li>
                            <li><strong>Mould spores are a potent trigger</strong> — Aspergillus and Alternaria species commonly found in damp carpets are classified as severe asthma triggers by the World Health Organisation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If anyone in your household has been diagnosed with asthma and you have carpeted floors, professional deep cleaning should be treated as a health intervention — not a cosmetic one.</p>

                    <!-- Section: What Doesn't Work -->
                    <section id="what-doesnt-work">
                        <h2>What doesn't work</h2>
                        <p>There's a lot of advice out there about managing carpet allergens. Some of it is well-meaning but ineffective.</p>
                        <p><strong>Regular hoovering alone.</strong> Hoovering removes surface debris but doesn't extract allergens embedded at the fibre base. Without a sealed HEPA filter system, hoovering can actually make things worse by disturbing allergens and redistributing them through the exhaust air. Even with a HEPA hoover, you're only addressing the top layer.</p>
                        <p><strong>Carpet deodoriser powders.</strong> These products mask odour with fragrance and add a fine powder to the carpet pile. They don't kill bacteria, remove allergens, or reach the fibre base. Many contain fragrances that can themselves trigger allergic reactions or asthma symptoms.</p>
                        <p><strong>Antibacterial carpet sprays.</strong> Surface application means surface results. These sprays don't penetrate deep enough to reach the bacteria, mould, or allergens embedded in the lower carpet pile and backing. They may reduce surface bacterial counts temporarily, but the reservoir below is untouched.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rental carpet cleaners.</strong> Supermarket and hire-shop machines are better than nothing, but they operate at lower temperatures (40–50°C versus the 60–80°C of professional equipment) and with significantly less suction. This means they can't kill dust mites (which require temperatures above 60°C) and they often leave excess moisture in the carpet — increasing the risk of mould growth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Professional hot water extraction</strong> is the only method proven to remove allergens, bacteria, and pollutants from all levels of the carpet pile. Here's why it works where other methods fail:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Temperature</strong> — water heated to 60–80°C kills dust mites on contact and denatures the Der p 1 allergen protein, rendering it non-allergenic</li>
                            <li><strong>Penetration</strong> — high-pressure injection reaches the fibre base, backing, and even the top layer of underlay, where contaminants concentrate</li>
                            <li><strong>Extraction power</strong> — professional truck-mounted machines generate 10 to 15 times the suction of domestic equipment, removing water, loosened dirt, allergens, and bacteria in a single pass</li>
                            <li><strong>Controlled drying</strong> — proper extraction leaves the carpet damp rather than wet, with drying times of 4 to 6 hours — far too short for mould to establish</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Independent testing has shown that professional hot water extraction removes <strong>up to 98% of allergens</strong> and <strong>89% of airborne bacteria</strong> from treated carpets. For households with allergy sufferers, children, or pets, this isn't an upgrade — it's a necessity.</p>

                        <h2>Practical steps for your home</h2>
                        <p>You don't need to rip out your carpets. With the right routine, carpeted floors can be safe and comfortable for everyone in the household — including the smallest and most vulnerable members.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Professional deep clean every 6 months</strong> — this is the baseline for homes with children under five, pets, or allergy/asthma sufferers. Standard households should aim for every 12 months at minimum</li>
                            <li><strong>Hoover twice weekly with a HEPA-sealed machine</strong> — this won't replace deep cleaning, but it reduces surface allergen levels between professional treatments. Look for machines with sealed filtration systems that prevent exhaust redistribution</li>
                            <li><strong>Shoes off at the door</strong> — a simple rule that eliminates the single largest source of outdoor bacteria and pollutants entering your carpet. Provide a shoe rack or basket by the front door</li>
                            <li><strong>Wipe pet paws after walks</strong> — keep a damp cloth or pet wipes by the door. A 10-second paw wipe dramatically reduces the bacteria and mud transferred to your carpet</li>
                            <li><strong>Address spills immediately</strong> — blot (never rub) liquid spills with a clean cloth, working from the outside in. If liquid has soaked through to the backing, book a spot treatment sooner rather than later</li>
                            <li><strong>Keep humidity below 50%</strong> — dust mites thrive in humid environments. Use a dehumidifier or ensure adequate ventilation, particularly in bedrooms and living areas with carpet</li>
                            <li><strong>Wash pet bedding weekly</strong> — at 60°C to kill dust mites and reduce the dander load that transfers to carpet</li>
                        </ol>

                                <h3>Can dirty carpets make allergies worse?</h3>
                                <p>Yes. Carpets trap dust mite waste, pet dander, pollen, and mould spores deep in their fibres. Walking across the carpet resuspends these allergens into the air at breathing height, triggering symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes, congestion, and asthma attacks. Regular hoovering only addresses the surface — professional deep cleaning is needed to extract allergens from the fibre base.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="faq-item">
                                <h3>Are carpets safe for babies and toddlers?</h3>
                                <p>Carpets can be safe for young children provided they are professionally deep cleaned every 6 to 12 months. Babies and toddlers face higher exposure to carpet pollutants because they crawl, play, and put their hands in their mouths at floor level — the zone where allergen and bacteria concentrations are highest.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="faq-item">
                                <h3>How do pets affect carpet hygiene?</h3>
                                <p>Pets contribute dander (microscopic skin flakes), saliva proteins, urine traces, and outdoor contaminants tracked in on paws. Cat allergen Fel d 1 and dog allergen Can f 1 are sticky proteins that bond to carpet fibres and persist for months even after the pet leaves the room. Homes with pets should have carpets professionally cleaned every 6 months.</p>

                            <div class="faq-item">
                                <h3>Is professional carpet cleaning safe for children and pets?</h3>
                                <p>Yes. Hot water extraction uses heated water and mild, non-toxic cleaning solutions. After treatment, carpets are typically safe for light foot traffic within 2 hours and fully dry within 4 to 6 hours. We recommend keeping children and pets off the carpet until it's dry — after that, it's completely safe.</p>

                                <h3>How often should I clean carpets if I have pets and children?</h3>
                                <p>Every 6 months is the recommended baseline for homes with pets, young children, or allergy sufferers. Between professional cleans, hoover twice weekly with a HEPA-filtered machine, remove shoes at the door, and wipe pet paws after walks.</p>
